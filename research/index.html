                <li>My undergraduate thesis focused on providing insight into caregivers' perspectives of day habilitation services for individuals with developmental disabilities, a widely used yet understudied service.</li>
                <li>I designed a survey to assess caregivers' experiences with multiple services for their children with developmental disabilities in the community, from in-school to private services.</li>
                <li>I compared day habilitation's alignment with a family-centered model, focus on recreational and community skills, and accessibility for families of multiple backgrounds, to other services families access in the community.</li>
                <li>I found that families value day habilitation service's family-centered approach and focus on building recreational skills, providing a unique and high-quality intervention experience.</li>

                <button class="abstract-button" onclick="openTextModal('Service-learning is an educational approach combining theoretical skills and hands-on project applications, which is especially important for younger generations who guide and determine the future of their local communities. Multiplying Good: “Students in Action” (abbreviated “SIA”) is a program implemented within K-12 schools to address this need. Advisors, typically teachers, work with middle-school and high-school students to create service projects based on the students’ interests and the community’s expressed needs. However, there is inevitably a generational disconnect between advisors and students, which can create project and communication barriers, ultimately hindering students’ connection to the community. We are investigating closing this gap by taking on a mediator role as SIA coaches, working individually or in small groups, in four local schools within the Lafayette community. Thus far, we have observed our role is organically defined by the needs of students expressed verbally and implicitly. The utility of our role is influenced by the progress, experience, pre-existing group cohesion, and structural context of the student groups. This level of variability by school suggests the need for adaptability in this role to best fit the needs of student groups. Despite this variability, all schools demonstrated benefits from SIA coaches according to feedback from advisors and students, cultivating an atmosphere focused on project-based learning. Additionally, a city-wide service project is possible by helping form connections between our respective SIA groups and external resources, providing a new opportunity for all students to strengthen bonds between themselves and the greater community. We are continuing to research the degree of our roles’ utility and how it is nuanced within the individual schools.')">View Abstract</button>

                <h3>Early joint attention and language development in neurogenetic syndromes</h3>
                <p><em>33rd Butler Undergraduate Research Conference, Indianapolis, IN</em></p>
            <button class="abstract-button" onclick="openTextModal('Joint attention is a critical precursor skill for language acquisition in typical development. Despite prior research demonstrating that children with neurogenetic syndromes (NGS) have reduced joint attention and language skills, few studies have investigated how these abilities vary and are related to each other. In this study, we a) characterized joint attention and language skills across Angelman (AS), Down (DS), and fragile X (FXS) syndromes; and (b) examined whether joint attention is predictive of later language skills. We hypothesized that joint attention and language skills are most developed in DS, followed by FXS, and least in AS. We also expected joint attention to be positively related to and predictive of language skills. To test these hypotheses, we assessed joint attention and language in 36 (53% male) children with NGS (AS: n = 8; DS: n = 19; FXS: n = 9) across two timepoints (MT1age = 16.5 months; MT2age = 26.3 months). Based on parent-prompted joint attention presses, participants were categorized as having no, some, or consistent joint attention skills. We also measured language ability using the LENA device (Gilkerson & Richards, 2020), a wearable recorder that automatically provides a standard score of child vocalization count. We tested hypotheses using chi-square and one-way ANOVA statistical tests. Our results partially supported our hypotheses: joint attention did not differ across NGS for both timepoints (ps > .09), though language skills were less developed in AS than DS and FXS (ps < .05). Contrary to expectations, concurrent joint attention and language skills were not significantly related at either timepoint (ps > .30). Additionally, early joint attention did not predict later language skills (p = .86). Broadly, our findings suggest that AS, DS, and FXS may have more distinct language skills rather than joint attention abilities. Given that early joint attention was not predictive of language skills in our sample of children with NGS, further research is warranted to better understand whether associations between joint attention and language may differ for NGS and other high- and low-risk groups. Future studies may explore other potential predictors and better means to measure language development in NGS.')">View Abstract</button>
